# Online musiscal shop (index and search page) - Built time 72 hours

> This is a capstone/exam project for the [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org) module HTML/CSS. It is a musical instrument store for displaying different instrument including local varieties, this website was designed using HTML, CSS3/SCSS, Bootstrap, Font awesome with also an extensive use of the grid and flex properties. I used all SCSS core functionality: variables, mixins and color functions.
